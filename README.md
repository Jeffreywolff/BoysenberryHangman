# BoysenberryHangman

This is the Hangman game, where you can guess a letter or a word. You only have 7 faulty guesses before the man is hanged.
A sound will be played if you have guessed right or wrong.

HOW TO GET THE SOUND WORKING:
In the HangmanModel class you have to change the filepath for the sound to where your 
sound files is. If it cant find the file or if it is not .wav format it will give you an error message.
